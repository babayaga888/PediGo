# Pedi-Go

Pedi-Go is a Flutter project that demonstrates a basic implementation of passenger and driver interaction using Google Maps. The app allows passengers to notify available drivers, enables drivers to pick up passengers, and uses Google Maps to choose the nearest path during travel. The app also provides payment estimates that aim to be fair to both passengers and drivers.
